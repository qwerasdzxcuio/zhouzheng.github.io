## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! My name is Zhou Zheng, and I am currently a first year (2020-) Ph.D. student at the Department of Intelligent Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University, supervised by Prof. [<font color=Blue>Kensaku Mori</font>](http://www.newves.org/wiki/).

Previously, I received the Master degree from Institute of Mechanical Engineering in Zhejiang University, and my thesis is about Research of the Segmentation Method for Liver and Liver Tumor in CT Images Based on A Unified Level Set Framework.

My research interest is about medical image analysis. I was obsessed with the application of level set algorithm in medical image analysis before, now I am dedicated to designing efficient machine learning methods for medical image analysis, especially unsupervised models.
