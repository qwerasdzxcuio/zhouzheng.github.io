### <font color="#006666">Biography</font>

My name is Zhou Zheng, and I am going to be a first year (2020-) Ph.D. student at the Department of Intelligent Science, Graduate School of Informatics, [<font color="#006666">Nagoya University</font>](http://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/), supervised by Prof. [<font color="#006666">Kensaku Mori</font>](http://www.newves.org/wiki/).

I received the Master degree from [<font color="#006666">Zhejiang University</font>](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), and my thesis is about research of the segmentation method for liver and liver tumor in CT images based on a unified level set framework. After graduation, I had several industry experiencesï¼Œlike the role as a software and algorithm engineer in [<font color="#006666">Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd</font>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei).

My research interest is about medical image analysis. I was obsessed with the application of level set algorithm in medical image analysis, now I am dedicated to designing efficient machine learning methods for medical image analysis, especially unsupervised models.
