## Biography

<img class="profile-picture" src="zhengzhou.jpg">

My name is Zhou Zheng, and I am going to be a first year (2020-) Ph.D. student at the Department of Intelligent Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University, supervised by Prof. [<font color="#006666">Kensaku Mori</font>](http://www.newves.org/wiki/).

I received the Master degree from Institute of Mechanical Engineering in Zhejiang University in March 2019, and my thesis is about research of the segmentation method for liver and liver tumor in CT images based on a unified level set framework. After that, I worked as a software and algorithm engineer in [<font color="#006666">Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd</font>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei).

My research interest is about medical image analysis. I was obsessed with the application of level set algorithm in medical image analysis, now I am dedicated to designing efficient machine learning methods for medical image analysis, especially unsupervised models.
